# Loan-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of loan default using
machine learning techniques. We utilize demographic information, loan de-
tails, and credit history from a public dataset to predict loan defaults. A
Random Forest Classifier is employed, and the model is evaluated using ac-
curacy, precision, recall, AUC, and feature importance metrics. The result
is a predictive model that aids financial institutions in reducing loan default
risks by identifying high-risk borrowers early.
